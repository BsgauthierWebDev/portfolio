        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class = 'group'>
            <div class = 'item item-double'>
                <p>I started out working in Operations and Logistcs in a few different positions
                    before starting down the road to software development. Along the way I've developed
                    a skill set that helps in the workforce.
                </p>
                <p>In my past work experience, I've been a member of several teams, both as a team member 
                    and leader. I have experience both working on my own and with others. I also have 
                    experience leading a team towards a common goal.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to my work history, I have a long history in music. Playing in ensembles, 
                    both large and small, has also taught me the value of teamwork and a group 
                    coming together towards a common goal. In addition to the teamwork involved in 
                    music ensembles, it has also helped me develop a creative side.
                </p>
                <p>I also have honed my creative skills in the kitchen, creating and sampling dishes 
                    from all over the world. Cooking for myself and my family has been another way 
                    to expand my skill pallette, further develop my creativity and spend time with 
                    my family and friends.
                </p>
